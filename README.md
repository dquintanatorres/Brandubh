This repository contains a university assignment implemented in Spanish. It features an Irish board game of Viking origins, which is a variant of Hnefatafl and part of the Tafl games family - ancient Northern European strategy board games.

The game can be launched via a CLI (`ejecutar_textui.bat`) or a GUI (`ejecutar_gui.bat`). These scripts are designed for Windows systems. For environments without a graphical interface, such as remote servers, `ejecutar_textui.bat` is recommended.
